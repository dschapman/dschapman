### Hi there 👋 

My name is Daniel. I write poems, articles, and tinker with code. My background is in the liberal arts (English Literature) but I've worked in cybersecurity and non-profit communications.

#### 🔭 I’m currently working on 
- Maintaining [my website](/dschapman/my-website), built with GatsbyJS and complete with functioning link previews.

#### 🌱 I’m currently learning 
- GatsbyJS / React
- SwiftUI to build my first app
- Doom Emacs / Org-Roam ([Check out my Doom dot files](https://github.com/dschapman/.dot_files/tree/master/.doom.d))
  - Curious to configure this for word processing / writing long form prose.
